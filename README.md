# Project 2: xkcd Password Generator

## Live URL
<http://p2.masbaty.me>

## Description
In this project, I created a password generator in the style suggested by the webcomic xkcd. The author suggested using passwords that are easy to remember, but difficult for a hacker to guess. Instead of using a short combination of random letters, numbers, symbols, and capital letters, we will be using a short sequence of normal words.
